                    <p>"Should i write this piece of code for implementing this new functionality by adding/editing the Theme files themselves or should i write it in a plugin?"</p>

                    <p>It’s a question that I have come across more than once, but I think there’s a series of questions that i can ask myself before jumping into writing any code.</p>

                    <p>
                    Usually, the answers to these lies in the true definition of a theme and the true definition of a plugin, but we tend to overlook it many a times and concentrate more on getting the functionality done as soon as possible ignoring the fact where this code should actually be. 
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Drawing the Line Based on The Feature</h2>

                    <p>Now, this isn’t to oversimplify the process because I realize there is some overlap, so there isn’t a hard line to be drawn, but I think there needs to be a significant point at which we know when something should be a child theme or a plugin.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>If while building a theme with even the slightest bit of advanced functionality, how should that functionality be developed?</li>
                        <li>And if the feature in question has to do with design but should implement a menu option to toggle something, where does it belong?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 >Writing the Child Theme?</h3>

                    <p>For a feature that calls for something such as a font manager in the existing theme, this certainly has to do with the design. The initial reaction is to think about adding the child theme.</p>

                    <!-- <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/post-sample-image.jpg" alt="">
                    </a>
                    <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span> -->

                    <p>The thing is, the core business need here is for a font manager. This means that there’s some functionality built into this request that assumes there’s going to be a set of data that must be managed.</p>

                    <p>According to all i know so far themes in WP don’t manage data – they are just the presenter of data.<br>
                        So, to that point, I believe it should be wrapped in a plugin.</p>

                    <h3>Write the plugin?</h3>

                    <p>Now, i recently came across a small feature to which was likely to add four widgetized areas in a customized footer above the default footer(not actually used). The dealing here was for introducing a functionality that allows this customized footer to have a set of additional widgets but that functionality is already built into the WordPress API.</p>

                    <p>So, in this particular case, I chose to create a simple child theme that introduces a secondary container above the footer with four widgetized areas.</p>

                    <p>Most of the times, the design relating issues are handled by child themes, and functionality related issues are handled by plugins.</p>

                    <p class="conclusion-text">Finally, understanding the core business need and how it relates to the existing WP site is the main thing i suppose, because it’s not always sufficient to understand the difference in design and functionality.</p>
